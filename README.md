---

## ❌ REMAINING TASKS (Do In This Order)

---

### 1️⃣ BUY CUSTOM DOMAIN — ₹500 (Do Today)
**Why first:** AdSense needs it. Razorpay looks professional. Resend email works.
**Time:** 30 minutes

```
Best options (check availability):
→ commentpull.in        (~₹500/year) ⭐ RECOMMENDED
→ crestlabs.in          (~₹500/year) — good for all future products
→ ytcommentpull.com     (~₹800/year)
```

**Steps:**
1. namecheap.com → search domain → buy
2. Vercel → your project → Settings → Domains → Add Domain
3. Namecheap → Advanced DNS → add 2 records Vercel gives you
4. Wait up to 24 hours → site live on custom domain

**After buying, update these 4 places:**
- Vercel env var: `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.in`
- Supabase → Authentication → URL Configuration → new domain + redirect URLs
- Razorpay → Settings → Webhooks → update webhook URL
- Resend → Add domain → update `from:` in `app/api/send-otp/route.ts`

---

### 2️⃣ PRIVACY POLICY + TERMS PAGES (1 hour — Required for AdSense)
**Why:** Google AdSense REQUIRES these pages before approving.
**Time:** 1 hour (ask Claude to generate)

```
Ask Claude: "Generate a Privacy Policy page at app/privacy/page.tsx 
and Terms of Service at app/terms/page.tsx for CommentPull — 
a YouTube comments downloader SaaS. Use the same dark theme."
```

Also update footer links in `app/page.tsx` from `href="#"` to:
- `/privacy`
- `/terms`
- `mailto:hello@crestlabs.in`

---

### 3️⃣ BLOG + FAQ PAGES (3-4 hours — Required for AdSense)
**Why:** AdSense wants real content. Also brings SEO traffic.
**Time:** Half day (ask Claude to generate all of it)

**Pages to create:**
```
app/blog/page.tsx
app/blog/how-to-download-youtube-comments/page.tsx     ← 1,500 words
app/blog/youtube-comment-analysis-guide/page.tsx       ← 1,200 words  
app/blog/best-youtube-comment-tools/page.tsx           ← 1,000 words
app/faq/page.tsx
```

**Target keywords (low competition):**
| Keyword | Monthly Searches |
|---------|-----------------|
| youtube comments downloader | 8,100/mo |
| download youtube comments csv | 2,400/mo |
| export youtube comments | 3,200/mo |
| how to download youtube comments | 5,400/mo |

```
Ask Claude: "Write a complete SEO-optimized blog post for 
'How to Download YouTube Comments' targeting 1,500 words. 
Create it as a Next.js page at app/blog/how-to-download-youtube-comments/page.tsx
using the same dark theme as the rest of CommentPull."
```

---

### 4️⃣ APPLY FOR GOOGLE ADSENSE (30 min — Passive Income)
**Why:** ₹1,000-15,000/month passive income from ads, even free users earn you money.
**When:** After domain + privacy/terms + blog pages are live.
**Time:** 30 minutes to apply, 1-2 weeks for approval.

**Steps:**
1. Go to adsense.google.com
2. Sign in with Google → Get Started
3. Enter your custom domain
4. Copy the verification `<script>` tag they give you
5. In Cursor, open `app/layout.tsx` → paste inside `<head>`:
```tsx
<script
  async
  src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXX"
  crossOrigin="anonymous"
/>
```
6. Deploy → Submit for review
7. Wait 1-2 weeks

**After approval, replace the placeholder in `app/page.tsx`:**
```tsx
{/* Find this div and replace: */}
<ins className="adsbygoogle"
  style={{ display: 'block' }}
  data-ad-client="ca-pub-YOUR_ID"
  data-ad-slot="YOUR_SLOT_ID"
  data-ad-format="auto"
  data-full-width-responsive="true"
/>
```

**Realistic earnings:**
| Monthly Visitors | AdSense Revenue |
|----------------|-----------------|
| 5,000 | ₹500-1,000 |
| 20,000 | ₹2,000-5,000 |
| 50,000 | ₹5,000-15,000 |
